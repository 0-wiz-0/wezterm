# `pane:move_to_new_window([WORKSPACE])`

{{since('nightly')}}

Creates a window and moves `pane` into that window.

The *WORKSPACE* parameter is optional; if specified, it will be used
as the name of the workspace that should be associated with the new
window.  Otherwise, the current active workspace will be used.
