# disable_default_quick_select_patterns

*Since: nightly builds only*

When set to `true`, the default set of quick select patterns
are omitted, and your [quick_select_patterns](quick_select_patterns.md)
config specifies the total set of patterns used for [quick select mode](../../../quickselect.md).
