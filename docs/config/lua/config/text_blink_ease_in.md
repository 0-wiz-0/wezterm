# text_blink_ease_in = "Linear"

*Since: nightly builds only*

Specifies the *easing function* to use when computing the color
for text that has the blinking attribute in the fading-in
phase--when the text is fading from the background color to the
foreground color.

See [visual_bell](visual_bell.md) for more information about
easing functions.

See [cursor_blink_rate](cursor_blink_rate.md) to control the rate
at which the cursor blinks.
