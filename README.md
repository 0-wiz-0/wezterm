# Wez's Term

## What?

Here's what I'm shooting for:

* A terminal escape sequence parser
* A differential screen protocol
* Textual and GUI rendering of the screen protocol

This would manifest as a common core that could run as both a textual
terminal multiplexer and a gui terminal emulator, where the GUI part
could automatically provide a native UI around the remotely multiplexed
terminal session.
