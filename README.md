## Getting help

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me.  There are two channels for support:

* You can use the GitHub issue tracker to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one: https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues
* There is a gitter room for (potentially!) real time discussions: https://gitter.im/wezterm/Lobby

The gitter room is probably better suited to questions than it is to bug
reports, but don't be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable using
and we'll work it out.
